# HeartDiseasePrediction
Heart disease prediction using Logistic Regression

This Project is about predictiong wether a person has heart disease or not

The data field:

id - unique id
age - age in years
sex - (1 = male; 0 = female)
cp - chest pain type (0,1,2,3)
trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl
fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
restecg - resting electrocardiographic results (0,1,2)
thalach - maximum heart rate achieved
exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0,1,2)
ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal - 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
condition - 0 = disease, 1 = no disease
