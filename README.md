2. age - age in years
3. sex - (1 = male; 0 = female)
4. cp - chest pain type (0,1,2,3)
5. trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
6. chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl
7. fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
8. restecg - resting electrocardiographic results (0,1,2)
9. thalach - maximum heart rate achieved
10. exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
11. oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
12. slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0,1,2)
13. ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
14. thal - 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
15. condition - 0 = disease, 1 = no disease
